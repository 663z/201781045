The goal of this project is to identify areas in Leeds where there is a high demand for senior care workers for medical companies or medical practitioners. 
The target population is mainly people who are older and have medical conditions. In addition, due to the need for senior care workers, the income and occupation of the target population are also taken into consideration.
The result of this task is to locate the areas with higher demand in Leeds using kmeans cluster analysis.
